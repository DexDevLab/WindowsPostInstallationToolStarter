# Windows-Post-Installation-Tool-Starter
 Simple program to show a message and wait for the Windows Post Installation Tool resource files.

## Project Implementation Causes

 When I implemented a system who wait for the resource files of the Windows Post
 Installation Tool (v3.0+), I haven't noticed that will be harsh to change the
 program INSIDE the Windows Image anyway, since the program is still inside.
 In this proposal, inside Windows Image we will have a simple starter, and the
 tool in fact will be provider by the technitian with the resource folders.
